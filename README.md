*This telegrammbot is an analogue of a real magic ball*
The essence of the magic ball is that you ask the ball a question, and it gives answers
The answer options are divided into groups:
1. Positive
2. Hesitantly positive
3. Neutral
4. Negative
## Description
* Magic in 8 Ball is a ball that looks like a billiard ball No. 8, but is larger â€” usually 10-11 cm in diameter, inside which there is a container with a dark liquid, for example, ink.
* The most common way is holding the ball in his hands (with the window down), the user asks him a question, shakes it, turns it over and reads the answer that appears.
* Traditionally, the ball has 20 answers, which can be divided into four groups.
